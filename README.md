# Blocknode

NodeFlow is a powerful Angular-based application that allows users to design backend services visually by dragging and dropping functional nodes on a canvas. With a dynamic state management system powered by NgRx, NodeFlow simplifies backend architecture creation by offering a visual interface where nodes represent backend components like servers, routes, middleware, and custom code blocks.

Each node can be configured, moved, and connected to other nodes to build a fully functional backend system. The application is ideal for developers looking to abstract away the complexities of backend coding by offering a Figma-like experience for backend design.

# Use Cases:
- Backend API Design: Quickly design REST APIs by visually connecting server, route, and middleware nodes without writing a single line of code.
- Middleware Management: Integrate complex middleware flows by chaining middleware nodes between servers and routes, offering an easy way to manage logic execution.
- Education and Prototyping: This is ideal for teaching backend concepts or quickly prototyping backend architectures for proof-of-concept projects.
